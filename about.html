        <p class="hero-about-description">
        Born and raised in Recife, Brazil, I moved to Lisbon, Portugal, in 2018 to pursue my Bachelor's degree in Marketing and Advertising. But in the last year of my Bachelor's degree, I discovered User Experience and Human-Centered Design, and suddenly I was sure of what exactly I wanted to pursue in my professional career.
        <br>
        Since 2020, I've been studying and practicing User Experience Design, developing and improving my soft and hard skills to become a better professional in this field that I fell in love with. Currently, I'm finishing my post-graduation in Digital Experience Design at the Faculty of Fine Arts of the University of Lisbon and I'm looking for a new challenge to show my skills and get knowledge from my colleagues.</br>
        <br>
        Since I started studying this field, I've worked for international NGOs, design studios and some of the biggest companies in the Portuguese tech market.
        Outside of design, I love discovering and sharing music, I am an enthusiast of movies, TV series and art in general, and I love doing any kind of sport or physical activity.</br>
